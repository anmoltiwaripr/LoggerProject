# LoggerProject

Overview
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for log generation, processing, analysis, and visualization using Python. It is designed for learning and experimenting with log analytics, troubleshooting, and monitoring concepts.

Features
Synthetic Log Generation:
Generates realistic log entries with random timestamps, log levels, user IDs, and actions.

Log Processing:
Parses log files and loads them into a pandas DataFrame for structured analysis.

Log Analysis:
Calculates statistics such as log level distribution, action frequency, unique users, and trends over time.

Visualization:
Plots log trends to help identify patterns and anomalies.

Web Scraping Example:
Includes a script to scrape links containing "python" from a website and save them to a JSON file.
